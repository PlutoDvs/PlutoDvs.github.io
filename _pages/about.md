Hello👋, I’m Nima, a software engineer and a graduate of Amirkabir University of Technology with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. My journey into the world of technology began well before university, but it truly flourished as I pursued my degree. In addition to my core studies, I chose to delve into the fascinating and interconnected realms of Distributed Systems, Databases, and Deep Learning. I've always been driven by a genuine curiosity about how things work at a fundamental level, and these fields get right to the heart of building modern, large-scale technology.

My Research interests
======
📚 My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision, exploring innovative ways to enhance human-computer interaction and data-driven decision making. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enable machines to better understand, generate, and interpret visual and textual data, with applications ranging from autonomous systems to AI-driven content generation. Additionally, I have a growing interest in cryptography, where I explore secure and privacy-preserving machine learning techniques, aiming to safeguard data integrity in the evolving landscape of AI.

Other interests and hobbies
======
🧗‍♀️ Beyond my research, I am passionate about video game design and development, where I enjoy creating interactive experiences that blend creativity and technology. Crafting games allows me to explore the dynamics of storytelling, immersive environments, and the mechanics of player engagement. Outside the digital world, I am an avid climber and enjoy hiking in nature, seeking out new challenges and the serenity of the outdoors. Whether scaling a rock face or exploring remote trails, these activities provide both adventure and a sense of balance in my life.

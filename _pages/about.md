Hello👋, I’m Nima Ebrahimi, currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Amirkabir University of Technology. My journey into the world of programming commenced during my high school years and continued to flourish as I pursued my higher education in Computer Science. In addition to my major in Computer Science, I chose to delve into the fascinating realm of Machine Learning, a decision that has significantly enriched my perspective. This exploration was more than a choice; it was a nod to my childhood, shaped by my interest beginning in my early age.

My Research interests
======
📚 My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision, exploring innovative ways to enhance human-computer interaction and data-driven decision making. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enable machines to better understand, generate, and interpret visual and textual data, with applications ranging from autonomous systems to AI-driven content generation. Additionally, I have a growing interest in cryptography, where I explore secure and privacy-preserving machine learning techniques, aiming to safeguard data integrity in the evolving landscape of AI.

Other interests and hobbies
======
🧗‍♀️ Beyond my research, I am passionate about video game design and development, where I enjoy creating interactive experiences that blend creativity and technology. Crafting games allows me to explore the dynamics of storytelling, immersive environments, and the mechanics of player engagement. Outside the digital world, I am an avid climber and enjoy hiking in nature, seeking out new challenges and the serenity of the outdoors. Whether scaling a rock face or exploring remote trails, these activities provide both adventure and a sense of balance in my life.

Hello👋, I’m Nima, a software engineer and a graduate of Amirkabir University of Technology with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. My journey into the world of technology began well before university, but it truly flourished as I pursued my degree. In addition to my core studies, I chose to delve into the fascinating and interconnected realms of Distributed Systems, Databases, and Deep Learning. I've always been driven by a genuine curiosity about how things work at a fundamental level, and these fields get right to the heart of building modern, large-scale technology.

My Research interests
======
📚 My primary interests lie in Distributed Systems, Databases, Blockchains, IoT, and AI. I continuously expand my expertise in these areas by reading technical literature, including books and research papers, and by following university-level courses.

Other interests and hobbies
======
🧗‍♀️ When I’m not working, I try to get moving. A lot of my free time is spent rock climbing—which I love for its mix of physical and mental problem-solving—or hiking in the mountains whenever I get the chance. For downtime, I’ll either dive into some classic Persian literature or just unwind with a good video game.
